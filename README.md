# Code Park High School Class Materials

This is the Materials repo for Code Park High School classes

Currently only has lesson one slides, but will grow to include tickets and printed materials.  Is intended to have everything to do with classes that is not the curriculum itself, and starter project files.  Those will be in separate repos.

Slides using the excellent [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)
