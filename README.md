# Code Park High School Class Materials

This is the Materials repo for Code Park High School classes

Currently it only has lesson slides, but will grow to include tickets and other printed materials.  It is intended to have *almost* everything required for the classes. The curriculum itself and starter project files will be in separate repos.

Slides made using the excellent [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)
