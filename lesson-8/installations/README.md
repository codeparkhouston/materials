# What is Git?

Git helps us track different versions of our code throughout time and to share our code with other people.  You can think of it as a backup system for our code.

The way we will use Git will be through something called a terminal, or command prompt.

It looks a little crazy and weird because we can't click on anything and we have to type certain phrases to get it to do things, but using this will make us awesome hackers and feel powerful, like wizards performing spells on our computer.
