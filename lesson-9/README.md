Now that we have `hello` tracked, let's get ready to share it by

# Signing up for [github.com](https://github.com)

1. Sign up on the form on the right: [github.com](https://github.com)

1. If it asks about a plan, pick the free one.

1. You're all signed up!

Github hosts our repositories -- it makes it so that we can reach our code online.  We can put our git repo there by first making a place for the repository.

# Make a repository online

1. Click on the plus sign by your username.

1. Click on `New Repository` from the drop-down.

1. Let's name our repository `hello`, just like our directory name.  Matching the name of the repo online with our repo locally helps us stay organized.

1. Click 'Create Repository'.

# Connect the `hello` repository on our computer to it's new online home.










Let's try this again with our site project!

# Making our site project a git repository

One way to share our site's code and see it online is to make it a git repository and put it on Github.  Let's start with making our site into a git repo (short for repository).

Like we did with our `hello` directory,

1. **c**hange **d**irectory into the project directory.

1. Tell **git** to **init**ialize in the directory.

1. Tell **git** to **add** all the files in the directory to the stage.

1. Tell **git** to **commit** the changes with a **m**essage describing what we are doing.

Now, we have the code for our site tracked.  We can share it on Github by:

1. Creating a new repo to match it on github.
